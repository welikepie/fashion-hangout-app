DATA FILE FORMAT
----------------

Data should be provided in JSON format.
The entire data set should be an array of objects (as in, the entire text document should start with "[" and end with "]").
Each item is a collection of properties, which should be written as follows:

{                                   <- open curly bracket
	"key": value,                   <- each key should be in double quotes, followed by colon; value depends;
	                                   remember about comma if it's not the last key-value pair in a set
	"another_key": another_value
},                                  <- close curly bracket; comma follows if it's not the last set

----------------

To demonstrate on the example entry, total of five properties are to be included:

{
	"id": 3,
	
	"name": "SLEEVELESS STUD CHECK SHIRT",
	"description": "Sleeveless check shirt with front poppers and stud detail pockets. 100% Cotton. Machine washable.",
	"photo": "http://media.topshop.com/wcsstore/TopShop/images/catalog/13S01DPNK_normal.jpg",
	
	"outfits": [2, 3]
}

id          - an integer, used to indentify the product uniquely; doesn't have to be sequential,
              but needs to be unique; no two products should have the same ID

name        - name of the product, as it will be displayed; simple text wrapped in double quotes

description - short description of a product, as it will be displayed; again, simple text wrapped in double quotes

photo       - URL pointing to the image of the product; web address, accessible from browsers, wrapped in double quotes

outfits     - list of outfits of which the product is the part; each outfit can from single item of clothing to many;
              additionally, clothes can be part of many outfits; with numbers used to identify the outfits, all items
			  that have the same number listed will be part of the same set; similarly, one item can have multiple numbers
			  to indicate it being a part of multiple outfits; it should be a list of integers, separated by comma,
			  wrapped in square brackets

Additional file has been attached, named "data_example.json". It's an example of how such data file should look. It contains
several example products (taken from Topshop's website), with their name, description and photo URL, as well as list of
which outfits the item belongs to.

Should any validation be needed on whether the file was properly formatted, http://jsonlint.com/ can be visited.
A simple site for JSON validation, can be used by copying the entire data document into the text area and clicking "Validate".
If, under results, "Valid JSON" on green background is visible, the file is properly formatted. Otherwise, an error on red
background will give the line number on where it encountered a problem.
